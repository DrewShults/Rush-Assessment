                    Album Viewer Website - Static page used to view albums and the song titles/song id's within those albums. Author-Andrew Shults

                   -Added UI functionality to view and scroll through large amounts of data. Rolling window affect used to handle larger sets of data.
                   -If more data was required it would likely be be better to build this differently and use an actual database rather than buildTable function. As for now it handles 10,000 rows fine.

To run download index.html and then open that file.
If different data is needed add it to index.html under var tableData
